                <p class = "paragraph">After gathering the research, our team began creating the wireframes. Our team was divided into two smaller teams. One team focused on the main website, which used Squarespace as its platform. The other team, which consisted of team members A, C and myself, focused on the order page. The order page used Square as its platform. My main task was to understand Square and assist in creating mid-fidelity mockups for this platform. Initially, our team designed a low-fidelity mockup of the navigation bar for the main website (Squarespace platform) and the ordering page (Square platform), and our client approved of the design.  </p>

Throughout this process, my job was to reconfirm whether certain design ideas were possible on Square’s platform as the site had specific design limitations. After creating the mid-fidelity mockups for the main website and the order website, my entire team, excluding me, worked on creating the final wireframes for the client. My main task was making sure that the final wireframes lined up with Square’s capabilities. Team members A and C then worked on putting all of the wireframes together into one prototype. </p>

First, I learned how to be adaptive to many changes throughout this project. With COVID-19, my team faced challenges due to changes in regulations. Second, I learned skills from my team members. I learned about UX design and research from B and C. I learned how to be an effective leader from A and I learned how to be adaptive towards any task from D (They was a “jack-of-all-trades” and helped the team throughout every step of the process.) Finally, my client taught me how to keep an open mind. They had a vision of what they wanted, but they were open to all solutions that helped expand their vision. </p>
