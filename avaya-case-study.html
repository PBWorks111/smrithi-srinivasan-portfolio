The current support chatbot contained use cases that were outdated and redundant. Stakeholders believed the chatbot wasn’t supporting customers’ needs. The chatbot also had new use cases that needed to be included within the bot. </p>
                    <p class = "about-body-writing">User could use the old system within the internal help center, but there wasn’t enough traction from them. Stakeholders decided the bot was needed to be redesigned.  </p>

                    <p class = "about-body-writing">Our team also attempted to integrate the company’s generative AI through their APIs. The idea was to introduce customers to it for any use cases that didn’t exist. The API provided high level answers regarding products by absorbing data from existing knowledge bases, product articles, etc.  I helped my team do the following:</p>

We ended up exploring the ticket number, the token count returned to the customer, the initial personality prompt provided within the API.We also integrated a few parts of the generative AI with the older chatbot as well. </p>

                        <p class = "about-body-writing">As a consulting company, Avaya worked with different companies for different use cases. I got to work on two different voice bots that were considered legacy systems. Their recognition systems were very old. </p>
                        <p class = "about-body-writing">The first project was for an airlines. I reviewed their transcripts to understand which utterances/words were recognized by the system and which ones weren’t. I did this for the crew voicebot and their passenger voicebot. I ended up providing the following recommendations: </p>

                            <p class = "about-image-caption">Adding possible synonyms to existing use cases to help the bot recognize users’ utterances more</p>

                            <p class = "about-image-caption">Adding more time for accepting possible utterance responses</p>

                      <p class = "about-body-writing">Another project I worked was a voicebot for a utilities company. I helped test out street names in different languages. I was able to identify which names weren’t recognized by the system.</p>

                <section id="avaya-limitations">
                        <h2 class="about-section-title">Limitations</h2>
                        <p class = "about-body-writing">For the UX designs, there were situations where the transfer protocols for certain languages. Additionally, we had to make sure the generative AI and the current chatbot were working together.  The voicebots I worked on were legacy systems and didn’t have up to date software. </p>

                <section id="avaya-conclusion">
                    <h2 class="about-section-title">Conclusion</h2>
                    <p class = "about-body-writing">Overall, I learned a lot from this experience. I worked with tools like Nuance Transcription and parseTool for the voicebots. I also got to explore different AI tools like Cognigy and Google Dialogflow  more in depth for the new bot. Learning how to design was an amazing experience as I got to work with old style chatbots with generative AI. Overall, there’s still a lot more I wish I did. </p>
