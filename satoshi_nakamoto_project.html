For text messages, it takes about 90 seconds for a person to respond. Another consideration is the more complex a topic is, the more time it takes a user to respond. I also learned that people expected faster responses from text messages rather than emails and voicemails. Also, at least 1/5 of users expected people to respond to Twitter messages in less than 15 minutes. This indicates that some people want their messages immediately.  </p>

Throughout the quiz, the chatbot was designed to be suspicious of everybody. Nakamoto would slowly open up to users as they begun to get more questions correct. However, the more questions a user got wrong, the more suspicious Nakamoto became. A user flow diagram was created to help show how users would interact with the chatbot.

For example, I had to research Nakamoto’s personality and I created a mental persona of him that was very similar to a user persona. Also, I was able to test the bot on three people. Usually, user testing involves at least five people.  Since my user testers were colleagues, their responses might be biased. Also, all of the users had very little to no knowledge about Bitcoin. I never had an opportunity to test the chatbot on somebody who knew a lot about Bitcoin. </p>

                <p class = "satoshi_paragraph">Overall, developing the chatbot taught me how to understand a person’s personality/persona and how to replicate it. It was also the first time that I was able to test a product on a series of people. The actual next step would be to conduct user research on the chatbot. User research would involve having users go through the chatbot and asking users how they feel about different parts of the chatbot. To test the chatbot yourself, please click on the button below. Make sure you have a Facebook account to access the chatbot.</p>
