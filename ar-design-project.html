                    <p class = "about-body-writing">Since there was a lot of freedom for this project, I tried to think about an app that could be useful amidst COVID-19. After thinking about how people were turning to websites like Google Arts & Culture , virtual tours, etc to temporarily substitute tours and museum visits, and recognizing that physical landmarks would not last forever, I decided to create an app that showed different ancient buildings in augmented reality. With that, I created a problem statement to help me narrow my focus towards specific interactions.
                    </p>
                    <p class = "about-body-writing">Many landmarks around the world may not physically exist in the future. To help preserve their memories, an education app would be created that contains details about the different physical landmarks with actual 3D renderings of the landmarks themselves. This app would allow users to select different landmarks from different locations around the world. Once a user selects the landmark, they can tap on different parts of the landmark to get facts about it. Users can also increase or decrease the size of landmark to use as models. This is meant to be an educational tool to teach any user about a particular landmark. The app is not limited to any age group and is not meant to replace any apps designed for physical tours.</p>

                    <p class = "about-body-writing">Right after creating my problem statement, I went ahead and did a rapid competitive analysis on two apps that were similar to my idea.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="about-section-title">Civilisations AR</h2>

                    <p class = "about-body-writing">This app allows users to explore different artifacts upfront. Users can see different artifacts, such as a sarcophagus, mask or vase. The app allows users to change the size of these artifacts, listen to sound bites about the artifact’s history, and even read about the artifact’s history on another screen. The main con with this app is that users have to use the app on a flat surface. The artifacts are even categorized by different eras throughout human history. The main difference between what I will design and this app is that I want to focus on physical landmarks rather than actual objects. I also want my app to cover facts regarding the historical and architectural context for each physical landmark rather than just stick to historical facts.

                    <p class = "about-body-writing">This app allows users to view different products via Harvard Business Review’s textbooks. This tool only works with the textbooks and it brings up models where users can interact with them by touching buttons and rotating different parts of various models of machines. The app does not provide audio recordings of the actions that are occurring. Users have to rely on visual cues to understand what is going on in the AR. Also, users choose the AR models they want to see based on the page they are on in a Harvard Business Review textbook.

                    <p class = "about-body-writing">After doing a quick analysis, I decided to focus on key interactions I wanted to complete for the short term project. I decided to focus on two key interactions: The first interaction would focus allowing users to bring the actual landmark up in an AR view. This is the most important interaction as users need to be able to visually see the landmark in detail. The second interaction would focus on adding sound bites to the actual landmarks to allow users to learn more about them when tapping on different parts of it.</p>

                    <p class = "about-body-writing">Normally, in a UX project, I would conduct a user needs assessment to understand who my users were, what they were currently looking for in a potential idea, and how they would utilize the app. In this case, my project was focused on learning how to design with an AR tool as a whole. Prior to beginning the design process, I tried to figure out who my user was. Since my app was an educational app that was meant to substitute travelling, I decided to focus on two user groups: older people who like to travel and children who were currently learning about history.
                    </p>
                  

                    <p class = "about-body-writing">Once I figured out my user group, I begun creating the storyboard and physical prototype for the app. Below is a link to a video that shows what the storyboard and physical prototype look like.</p>

                     <br>
                    <p class = "about-body-writing">After creating both the storyboard and physical prototype, I tested them and received feedback from my professor and my friend. Here was some of the feedback I received: The app should be used vertically on mobile devices instead of horizontally. One user (my friend) mentioned that it felt more natural to hold the phone in one hand and do interactions in another. The settings panel was taken down since users can manually touch and change the orientation of the historical landmark. The user felt it would be more natural to move the app on our own.The visual panel was not added because I did not want it to be a distraction for other users as they interacted with the app. Also, due to time constraints, I was unable to include this part on the final design.

                    <p class = "about-body-writing">This mini-project was created in a short time frame and the app was not designed to be used in a professional setting. Rather, this was an introduction for me to learn more about augmented reality. If I had more time on this project, I would have attempted to learn more about my users’ needs. I would also have found users to test my design on instead relying on my student instructor and friend for feedback.

                    <h2 class="about-section-title">Conclusion </h2>
                    <p class = "about-body-writing">This project was a great introduction in augmented reality. I think that if I had more time, I would have attempted to polish my final design and recording. This was an opportunity for me to learn how to think outside of my normal scope of thinking and try a new tool. It also allowed me to be creative and think like a game designer in a way as I had to learn how to figure out camera angles, how people hold their phones, etc while utilizing this app. Although this mini-project was really short, I’m glad that I was able to try something new.
