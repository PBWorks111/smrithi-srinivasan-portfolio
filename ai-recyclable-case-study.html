                    <p class = "about-body-writing">I was part of a hackathon where we  had  to create a product that would create an impact on the world around us. My group and I ideated and we decide to create an AI app that would identify items that could be recycled. One part of our team led UX research, while I led the design team to create the app.  </p>

                    <p class = "about-body-writing">My group discussed all of their ideas and a majority came up with the idea of a gamifying app that would teach users how to recycle specific items with the help of image identification.</p>

                    <p class = "about-body-writing">We first started to ideate on a project concept we wanted to work on. We all knew wanted to work on AI, but we had different ideas like AI sentiment analysis, apps related to travelling, etc.  A majority of the group were interested/passionate about environmentalism and recycling. </p>
                    <p class = "about-body-writing">Another half of the group was interested in AI. With that in mind, we decided to create an app that could use AI to identify what an item was and how to recycle it.  On top of that, the developers on our team wanted to work with AI and wanted a challenge of making a progressive web app because of their personal interests. We ended up making a tablet and mobile version of the app for the developers.  </p>

                    <h2 class="about-section-title">UX Research</h2>
                    <p class = "about-body-writing">While I didn’t work on the UX research side, the team focused on several areas of research to help narrow down our idea.  The group started by interviewing people who were close to them in their age. They were asked questions about the following:</p>
                    
                    
                    <li class = "li-items">Background and occupation</li>
                    <li class = "li-items">How they recycle items </li>
                    <li class = "li-items">How they dispose items don’t know how to</li>
                    <li class = "li-items">How knowledgeable they are about recycling and their opinion on current resources that exist</li>
                    <li class = "li-items">Their motivations for recycling and the hardest parts/difficulties of recycling</li>
                    <li class = "li-items">If they knew about any apps related to recycling</li>
                    <p class = "about-body-writing">After that, the group made an affinity and empathy wall to display the findings.  Alongside the interview, a competitive analysis was done to see what types of apps existed in the market.</p>
                    <p class = "about-body-writing">From all the questions, they made an empathy map and affinity wall. The purpose of the extensive research was to understand the user group’s needs, desires within an app, the level of knowledge our users needed and their short and long term motivations.</p>
                    <p class = "about-body-writing">Here are the most important facts they learned.</p>
                    <li class = "li-items">There are different methods and ways people learn and practice recycling</li>
                    <li class = "li-items">Recycling can be tough if people don’t have access to resources and knowledge</li>
                    <li class = "li-items">Recycling is done when it’s convenient for them</li>
                    <p class = "about-body-writing">After completing all the research, two personas were made for the user. One user was named Mark, the pragmatic recycler and Rina the passionate recycler.</p>
                    <li class = "li-items">Mark Persona</li>
                    <li class = "li-items">Rina Persona</li>

                    <p class = "about-body-writing">When we got to the UX design process, we started with the ideation of the app’s design. This was our initial path.</p>
                    <li class = "li-items"> We were supposed to do the following feature prioritization, epic creation, site map, user flows, user journeys, low fidelity designs, round of user testing, mid-fidelity designs, another round of user testing and high fidelity designs with a final round of user testing.</li>
                    <li class = "li-items"> We followed the I like, I wish and What if framework to understand what features we wanted to include in the app. I worked with my team cluster our thoughts into common findings. These were the most common themes and the ideas we decided on.</li>
                    <p class = "about-body-writing">Other members of my group then created user stories by taking parts feature prioritization. After the feature prioritization, we decided the design of the app should be an app where people could collaborate with recycling facilities to recycle their items. Every time a person recycled anything at a facility, the facility would gain points. Along the way, people could learn what items to recycle.</p>
                    <li class = "li-items"> From there, with the help of the user personas, other team members ended up making two epics. The idea was to better understand the user’s journey within the app based on the features we had created. My team ended up these stories based on personas and features.</li>

                    <p class = "about-body-writing">We were about to start the actual app design by creating user flows. Unfortunately, we weren’t able to complete the task in a timely manner since there were lots of parts to consider.</p>
                    <p class = "about-body-writing">We ended up converging with UX research team members to figure out a possible user flow. This what we decided. </p>

                    <p class = "about-body-writing">Since our current project plan wasn’t working due to the amount tasks required, our team’s personal timeline and hackathon deadline.  </p>

                    <p class = "about-body-writing">I ended up leading up leading our team through the low fidelity designs and changed our plan altogether. Initially, we were supposed to do the following plan. I changed everything to meet our new timeline. </p>
                    <p class = "about-body-writing"> We spent three days working the basic design of the app. I ended up dividing my team members into the follow roles.  </p>

                    <p class = "about-body-writing"> We spend the first three days working on the low fidelity design with Nathan creating the style tile. I worked with the researchers in parallel to find users for testing. After we created the designs, we ended up doing usability test on the following. Gurleen and I came up with the following questions and got 4 users. Here is what we learned </p>

                    <p class = "about-body-writing">After my research, I drafted recommendations for immediate implementation to my supervisor. Firstly, my supervisor and I decided to give the welcome message clearer instructions for users to understand Breezy's functions easily. Secondly, we expanded the chatbot's personality by incorporating personalized responses on topics based on user feedback.</p>

                    </div> 
                    <p class = "about-body-writing">Initially, I suggested changing the reminders system either by removing it entirely or offering further customization options. However, due to limitations with Manychat, it wasn’t feasible. Lastly, I created user personas to better understand our target audience, as their identity was initially unknown during the research phase.</p>

                    <h2 class="about-section-title">Limitations</h2>
                    <p class = "about-body-writing">I encountered several limitations during this project. Firstly, the low response rate to my survey - only 6 from old users and 5 from new users – made it statistically insignificant even though there was a three-week wait for more responses. Another consideration is that I was given advice to reach out to users who used potential competitors of Breezy to understand their thoughts about her. However, at the time, my supervisor and I only knew of one competitor.There was also the possibility of bias in responses from previous users who may have been friends or family of employees. Finally, , our user selection wasn't restricted to one-time Breezy users. We tried to be inclusive as possible to get more users. </p>

                    <h2 class="about-section-title">Conclusion</h2>
                    <p class = "about-body-writing">This project brought me full circle, returning to the company that introduced me to UX/UI. I learned Breezy's unique personality and expanded its potential. It rekindled my interest in chatbots and user interaction with AI. As my first solo UX research project, it was a valuable learning experience. Moving forward, I aim to stay in AI and explore beyond chatbots..</p>
