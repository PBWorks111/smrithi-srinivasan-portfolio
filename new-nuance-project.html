Dragon Medical One is a voice transcribing tool doctors can use to record patient notes.  For CDE One, the search bar they used for finding medical codes needed to be redesigned. For Dragon Medical One, the user interfaces needed to be catalogued for future designers and engineers in the company. The product also needed a user analysis/heuristic evaluation to identify any usability painpoints.</p>

                <div class = "paragraph">  While I was documenting Dragon Medical One’s UIs, I also begun a user analysis to help diagnose potential areas for improvement within the system. I walked through the entire system as a new user with no prior history of using medical transcription tools. From there, I begun keep a personal log of every potential painpoint I found within the system. This was how I broke down the entire system with the same breakdown I used for the UI catalogue. </div>

                <div class = "paragraph">  For every problem area I found, I used Norman Nielsen’s heuristics to define the potential problem. From there, I used the following rating system to define how critical the painpoint was.  </div>

                <p class= "paragraph"> For both projects, I did not get any user feedback or interview notes from users. For the CDE One project, I had no choice but to rely on my supervisor’s feedback to understand the user’s needs. For the Dragon Medical One user analysis, I wasn’t able to focus on highlighting painpoints from the user’s perspective. Instead I had to highlight painpoints from the perspective of a new user using the device for the first time. </p>

            <div class = "paragraph-flex">
                <p class = "paragraph">This particular internship threw me for a curveball as I had to learn how to create proper user interfaces from scratch. Although, I learned how to create user interfaces in class, this internship made me realize I needed to go back to the basics. For projects related to Dragon Medical One, I had an opportunity to learn about a new type of recording technology. Prior to this internship, I never knew what about medical dictation software. But as I worked with the product, I learned about the potential and uses for it outside the medical industry. It made me realize that I wanted to continue to work with this type of technology in the future. This internship also made me realize that I want to continue to work in the medical field going forward.  </p>
