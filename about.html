                    <p class="about-body-writing ">Hello there! My name is Smrithi Srinivasan. I’m a UX practitioner with extensive experience in design, research, and writing. Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work across a several industries, including AI (specifically generative AI), healthcare, food and hospitality, human resources/recruitment, finance, and legal. I have also contributed to projects focused on sustainability, education, and incarceration.</p>

                    <p class = "about-body-writing">I grew up in the city of Detroit, Michigan, which has greatly influenced my life.

                        <p class = "about-image-caption">Image of Home Logo</p>
                        <p class = "about-body-writing">The home logo was created based on the idea of yin and yang. Finding balance in the field of UX is tricky. Although the user’s perspective is always the number one priority, there are always multiple views in UX design. I find myself trying to make the right decision while balancing different perspectives to create the best experience possible. The sign is a reminder that finding the right balance with different viewpoints takes a lot of work. The “S” is also included in the symbol to represent the initials of my first and last name. I always thought that backwards shape of the sign looked like an “S” and I wanted to incorporate my identity in the sign as well. </p>
