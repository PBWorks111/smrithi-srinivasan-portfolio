                    <p class = "about-body-writing">I worked at Axos Bank, a digital-first bank, in a technical role working on conversational AI platforms. During this time, I worked with both NLU-based chatbots and LLM-powered flows across a web chatbot, mobile app chatbot, and an IVR built on Five9. </p>
                    <p class = "about-body-writing"> During the first phase of my role, I worked on Axos Bank’s legacy NLU chatbot built on Abe.AI, which contained approximately 200–300 active intents. My responsibilities included updating and maintaining chatbot content, such as intent responses and conversational messaging, based on stakeholder feedback and internal product changes. In parallel, I worked on content updates and minor platform updates for an IVR built on Inference, which integrated with the Five9 telephony platform.</p>
                    <p class = "about-body-writing"> I did data analysis for the chatbot. This was the first time I did extensive data analysis for chatbots using a large number of transcripts.  I’ve done data analysis on a smaller chatbot. I never did it with a large chatbot.  I used the company’s Microsoft servers to see transcripts with conversations between users and the chatbot. From there, I would look at transcripts based on a node or part of Inference that operates specific flows with more automation needed. I would use SQL to attempt to look for customer utterances and trends that looked unusual within the last 3 to 6 months. Most of my findings helped me to create new utterances or create new intents for the chatbot. </p>

                    <h2 class="about-section-title">Migration Process</h2>
                    <p class = "about-body-writing">The company was moving from their old NLU chatbot platform to Google Dialogflow for its hybrid approach to older NLU styles. I was asked to do research for security vendors to protect our new AI. I looked at 7 vendors and we ended up deciding to use Google’s security tool. I looked for tools that were from private companies and were focused on manual detection versus using prompts for AI detection. </p>
                    <p class = "about-body-writing">I also worked on learning how to use Google Dialogflow. I was able to create a flow for helping people select the accounts they’re looking for. This was meant to help customers to select which account works for them based on asking questions about their preferences. Once a person got the product they could speak to an agent. If they didn’t find what they were looking for, they would speak to an agent still. I was also able to work on a project where I helped integrate Azure Bot Services with Google Dialogflow to help bring messages onto Teams through documentation provided by Google. I was able to learn about Google Cloud Platform and running code on it.  </p>

I was also able to learn about the financial industry and experience working with multiple types of platforms. </p>
