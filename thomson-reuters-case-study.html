                    <p class = "about-body-writing">Triva, or the Thomson Reuters Intelligent Virtual Agent, is a chatbot used for three customer segments: small business accountants, corporate accountants and legal professionals. They were created in June 2020 during COVID. I came in September 2022 and I joined when the company was working on adding new use cases. I worked with a Scrum team that included 12 development team members, 3 ops members (originally), 1 product manager, 1 product/UI designer and 1 other conversation designer. </p>
                    <p class = "about-body-writing">My daily tasks included: creating and updating different use cases and states (error states, live agent hours, etc). I also worked on side projects such as: a competitive analysis, NLU research (failure), incorporating Acrolinx (a grammar AI tool), etc to find ways to improve the chatbot.</p>

We also documented every path a user can take on each bot. The documentation was updated when changes were made to the bot.  </p>

                    <p class = "about-body-writing">Working in a large corporation brought new learnings: limited interaction due to silos, indirect customer understanding through SMEs and support agents, and a shift from immediate user feedback to observing impact through leadership and dashboards. I also had to independently maintain UX skills with tools like Figma. My failures included focusing on one-off terms in NLU updates, using incorrect customer terms in chatbots, delivering poor developer feedback, and ultimately experiencing a layoff.</p>

It reignited my passion for the field, allowing me to hone my skills and build use cases for diverse customer segments across legal and accounting. As a team member, I learned the ropes of corporate environments and witnessed the growing importance of AI in conversation design.</p>
