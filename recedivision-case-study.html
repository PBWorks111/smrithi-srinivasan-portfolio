He’s begun lashing out at his family members and he feels really bad about it. His wife has tried talking to him, but he feels like she doesn’t understand what he’s been through. One of his caseworkers recommended the “RecidiVision” app to find free resources to help him deal with his PTSD and to get connect with other prisoners who understand what he’s been through. He goes to his phone and looks up the app. From there, he finds an option to find a therapist based on his needs. From there he gets a list of recommended therapists he can visit. He also finds a feature that shows events and workshops hosted by established releasees and decides to go to one to find a community for himself.</p>

He currently has no money and no job and he’s having trouble navigating life outside of prison. He wants to get his life back on track but he doesn’t know what his options are given his criminal record. One day, he learns about the “RecidiVision” app through one of his ex-releasee friends. Wade downloads the app on this phone and finds a feature that allows him to watches videos that teach him vocational skills(like job interviews and creating a resume) and technical skills (like Microsoft Office, online tools, etc). He begins watching the videos and applying everything he learns by practicing using his local library’s computers. He also finds a meditation function that teaches him about mindfulness and breathing techniques to help control his anger so that he can manage his stress and effectively find a job for himself as soon as possible.</p>

When we created our mockups, we had to keep the following design constraints in mind for our users.</p>

With more time, we would have conducted additional interviews, created an affinity wall, and used other UX research methods, like surveys, to understand the experiences of recently released convicts. We also didn't conduct usability testing. Limited by time, we only created one set of designs but would have preferred to go through two or three design iterations.</p>

While many apps focus on global issues, we often forget about local needs. Though this app wasn't fully developed, I hope to expand on it in the future as a side project.</p>
