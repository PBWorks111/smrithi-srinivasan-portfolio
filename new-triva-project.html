They were created in June 2020 during COVID. I came in September 2022 and I joined when the company was working on adding new use cases. I worked with a Scrum team that included 12 development team members, 3 ops members (originally), 1 product manager, 1 product/UI designer and 1 other conversation designer.

            <div class ="paragraph">Since I worked with a scrum team, I completed mini-projects/tasks in two week cycles. I worked on creating and updating use cases for each chatbot, creating documentation for the chatbot (wiki articles and flow documentation/mapping), researching AI topics like NLU to keep the chatbot up to date, etc. For new use cases, I talked to subject matter experts (SMEs) or my project manager to gather information. This included any websites, articles, etc users would need. Next, I would build out the use cases on LucidSpark and map out every conversation point between the user, the bot and any additional systems. For unfamiliar tax and legal concepts, I would spend time researching the use cases online, if I had the opportunity, or use ChatGPT to summarize information for me. Once everything was mapped out, I presented the design to my project manager or SMEs for final approval. If they vetoed ideas, they’d provide their feedback on LucidSpark. Once the idea is approved, the development team takes my diagram and creates it all on the chatbot platform, Kore.AI. I provide final approval for the design based on content, how messages are written, etc.  For updating use cases, either my team member of I (usually my team member) look for areas of improvement or we bring ideas to meetings. After discussion about the changes needed, my counterpart or I would update the design on LucidSpark and get approval from our project manager.   </div>

        <div class = "paragraph-flex">
           <div class ="paragraph">For documentation, we had two types: creating articles for conversation design best practices and flow documentation. For articles, I wrote about different topics like the connection between UX and conversation design, NLU best practices, user personas for different bots, Triva’s bot persona (my manager wrote this for a presentation earlier), etc. My counterpart created articles about voice and tone, LLMs, etc. We also started creating articles for entry points to the bots, best practices for CXD in general, etc. These articles were used as our repisitory for best practices for conversation design. For flow documentation, my counterpart and I created a team repository on LucidSpark to house all of our designs. We also documented every path a user can take on each bot. When use cases were created, we wouldn’t update the documentation until it was developed and published by the development team. We also made sure to keep designs in place.  </div>

        <div class = "paragraph-flex">
            <div class = "paragraph"> The first side projects I worked on were a competitive analysis and heuristic evaluation.  These side projects allowed me to learn more about the chatbots, other chatbots in their respective industries and areas of improvement for each bot. I also worked on integrating Acrolinx, a grammar tool used by content teams, with Triva. I was able to use Acrolinx to standardize our writing style for the chatbot. I also updated the documentation for our chatbot as a side project when I wasn’t creating/updating use cases. I also created user personas for each bot based on previous user research from other segments within the company. This helped the team understand who our users were even though we never interacted with them daily. I also created an onboarding module/video to teach new members of the company about my work as a CXD and this help teach other people in the company what conversation design is and why Triva exists. I worked with my accessibility team lead to show what templates we use for Triva and go through an accessibility deep dive to give our customers equal opportunity to use Triva.  </div>

        <div class = "paragraph-flex">
            <div class = "paragraph"> I also worked on a content deep dive for Triva to discover and update content changes for all 3 bots were uniform. I also did research for a tool called “Intent Discovery” that was a new feature added to Kore. It allowed users to upload transcripts and find/discover new intents to add to your bot. I should note, that this was still in beta testing. I was able to identify new intents and even explore different intents to include for future use cases.  </div>

        <h5 class = "subheading">Limitations/Failures</h5> 
        <div class = "paragraph-flex">
            <div class = "paragraph">Since I work in a large corporation I learned a lot of new concepts. For example, I worked in a siloed environment and I rarely interacted with people outside my team. I had to find reasons to talk to new people outside of my main work group. Another limitation was that I never communicated with our main customers. Since I worked for a large company, I always learned about the customers through SMEs or my project manager. I rarely talked to our customers and the closest interaction I had with them was talking to support agents who interacted with customers every day. There was a large gap and I had to learn how to observe impacts of my work through other tools like dashboards or through feedback from leadership. I had to learn how to see the big picture from leadership’s point of view and that was a difficult process because I was always used to seeing the impact immediately from customer or user feedback. Also, I rarely used my user experience background to work with tools like Figma. I had to practice on my own to keep up with those skills.   </div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class = "paragraph-flex">
            <div class = "paragraph"> I also faced failures.  My first failure was when I attempted to find terms from transcripts that could be used to update our NLU. I ended up focusing on terms that could only be used for one off cases rather than multiple users. My second failure was when my counterpart and I learned we had used incorrect customer terms for one of the chatbots and neither of us knew we were using the wrong terms. This led emergency changes to 3 different use cases and they had to be published as quickly as possible. My colleague and I never noticed the issue until one of our SMEs let us know. My third failure was during a feedback session. One of our developers had made a change on the platform that I didn’t like. I was really unhappy about it and I was critical about the change made.  My final failure was when I was laid off along with several others.   </div>

            <div class = "paragraph-flex">
                <p class = "paragraph">Working as a conversation designer at Thomson Reuters was an amazing experience.  As a professional, I learned a lot about corporate environments and I had design mentors I could look up to. I think that the experience allowed me to utilize my conversation design skills. I remembered why I fell in love with conversation design and why I got into the field of UX/UI.  I got to build use cases for customers in different segments and I learned about their daily experiences through my team members. I learned about two different industries: accounting and legal. This job reminded me that conversation design is a niche field with lots of undiscovered exploration. With new changes in generative AI/LLMs, companies are beginning to recognize the importance of AI. I got to work for a company that was on the crux of these projects. </p>
