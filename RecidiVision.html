If we had more time, we would have attempted to do more interviews and we would have created an affinity wall to narrow down our findings. We would have also would have released surveys to get a better understanding of what recently released convicts experienced. Another consideration is that we did not do any usability testing. Again, due to our time frame, we were only able to create one set of designs. If we had more time, we would have gone through at least two or three rounds of design iterations.  </p>

               <p class = "bg_paragraph"> This project reintroduced to me to recidivism and made me realize that weren’t enough resources available to help guide them through life after incarceration. We see so many apps that are focused on helping other populations around the world that we sometimes forget people are in our neighborhood.  Although this app was never fully developed, I hope to expand on this idea in the future as a side project.   </p>
