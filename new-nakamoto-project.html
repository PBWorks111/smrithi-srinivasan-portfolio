    <p class = "paragraph">I also had an opportunity to research different areas of psychology to understand how long it took a person to respond to a virtual message. For text messages, it takes about 90 seconds for a person to respond. Another consideration is the more complex a topic is, the more time it takes a user to respond. I also learned that people expected faster responses from text messages rather than emails and voicemails. Also, at least 1/5 of users expected people to respond to Twitter messages in less than 15 minutes. This indicates that some people want their messages immediately.  </p>

    <p class= "paragraph">My supervisor decided that the chatbot would quiz users. Users would be tested on their knowledge of Bitcoin. If they passed the quiz, they would get a special prize. We did this to help teach users about Bitcoin while challenging more knowledgeable Bitcoin users on their skillset. </p>

    <div class = "paragraph-flex">
    <p class = "paragraph">The questions started at a beginner’s level to help introduce the topic of Bitcoin to newbies and to help people get their feet wet. From there, the questions became more difficult. There were three levels a person had to go through to win a prize. The prize was an incentive for passing all of the tasks. Throughout the quiz, the chatbot was designed to be suspicious of everybody. Nakamoto would slowly open up to users as they begun to get more questions correct. However, the more questions a user got wrong, the more suspicious Nakamoto became. A user flow diagram was created to help show how users would interact with the chatbot. The diagram is posted below.  </p>

        Throughout the design process, I focused on was making sure he was as human as possible. By highlighting his suspicious and secretive nature, it brought out Nakamoto's humanity. Also, my supervisor and I decided to create a question bank where users could ask the chatbot personal questions. This section was created if users failed the chatbot’s quiz. After seeing other chatbots engage with users on a personal level, I wanted to continue this trend with the question bank. Also, I timed the chatbot’s responses so that it would look like he was taking time to type out his responses.</p>

    <p class = "paragraph">While I was not a user researcher or designer for this project, there were parts of both that came into play. For example, I had to research Nakamoto’s personality and I created a mental persona of him that was very similar to a user persona. Also, I was able to test the bot on three people. Usually, user testing involves at least five people. Since my user testers were colleagues, their responses might be biased. Also, all of the users had very little to no knowledge about Bitcoin. I never had an opportunity to test the chatbot on somebody who knew a lot about Bitcoin. </p>

    <p class = "paragraph">Overall, developing the chatbot taught me how to understand a person’s personality/persona and how to replicate it. It was also the first time that I was able to test a product on a series of people. The actual next step would be to conduct user research on the chatbot. User research would involve having users go through the chatbot and asking users how they feel about different parts of the chatbot. To test the chatbot yourself, please click on the link below.
