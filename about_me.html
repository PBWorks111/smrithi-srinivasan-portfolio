            <br>
            <p>Hello! I'm Smrithi, a conversation designer and user experience designer. My passion for the fields began to blossom during my undergraduate studies, thanks to a Systems Analysis course and 2 internships. From there,  I pursued a master's degree, further building my expertise. Over the course of my professional journey, I've dedicated myself to honing my skills in both fields allowing me to explore the intersection of these disciplines. </p>
            <br>
            <p>As a hobby, I enjoy reading of comic books.  It's my creative escape and a constant source of inspiration. This hobby not only gives me a break from my work but also fuels my creativity, influencing my approach to design.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Thank you for taking the time to get to know a bit about me. I'm excited to connect with you!</p>
