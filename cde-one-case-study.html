                    <p class = "about-body-writing">For this project, I had to help redesign the search filter and create a low fidelity mockup of the redesigned filter. With the help of my supervisor, I was able to create the filters for the system. I cannot show the entire system. However, I can show some of the changes that were made. First, we combined two tab systems into one tab by having users click through the list next to the search bar to help reduce the number of clicks.</p>

                    <p class = "about-body-writing">This particular internship threw me for a curveball as I had to learn how to create proper user interfaces from scratch. Although, I learned how to create user interfaces in class, this internship made me realize I needed to go back to the basics.</p>
                    
                    <p class = "about-body-writing">But as I worked with the product, I learned about the potential and uses for it outside the medical industry. It made me realize that I wanted to continue to work with this type of technology in the future. This internship also made me realize that I want to continue to work in the medical field going forward.</p>
