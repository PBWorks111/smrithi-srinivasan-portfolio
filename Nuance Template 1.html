However, I can say that I had an opportunity work to help work on redesigning the search system for one of the products. I helped work on the low-fidelity mockups for CDE One. I was also able to conduct a user analysis on Dragon Medical One and create a guide to help point where changes were necessary throughout the system using Microsoft Sway. For more information about the two projects, please reach out to me personally.</p>
