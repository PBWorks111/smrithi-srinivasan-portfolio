                <p class= "paragraph">There were a number of limitations I faced throughout this project. The first limitation I faced first was from the number of responses I received for my survey. I only got 6 responses from old users and 5 responses from new users and this made the survey statistically insignificant. I waited three weeks for potential responses from previous users and I couldn’t get enough responses. </p>

However, at the time, my supervisor and I only knew of one competitor.  Also, some of the previous users may have been friends or family members of the company and their responses for using the product would have been slightly biased.  Finally, we never narrowed our spectrum of users to people who just used Breezy one time. Instead, we tried to be as inclusive as possible to get as much data as we could. </p>

             <div class = "paragraph-flex">
                 <p class = "paragraph">This project allowed me to come first circle as I was able to come back to the first company that introduced me to UX/UI. Working and learning about Breezy was a unique experience as I had to learn about her quirks and find a way to grow them to further develop her personality. Working on Breezy also reintroduced me to the world of chatbots and their expansive personalities. It also allowed me to learn more about how users interacted with different types of AI. While this project was the first solo UX research I conducted, it was a project that taught me so much about how to conduct different types of UX research. Going forward, I hope to stay within the field of AI and learn more about different types of AI that exist outside of chatbots. If I were to do this project over again, I would try to work around a longer timeline and include more research to narrow down on users’ particular needs and desires. </p>
