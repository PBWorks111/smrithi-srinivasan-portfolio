                    <p class = "about-body-writing">Initially, our client had proposed three projects we could choose from. Due to our timeline, we could not complete every single project and we decided to focus on two of the projects.</p>
                    <ul>
                            <li>The first project was to find a way to allow customers to make indoor reservations and prepay their beverages/food. Ideally, the goal was to organize everything through their point of sales</li>
                            <li>The second project was reorganizing the client’s websites to highlight their delivery, curbside and indoor patio seating options. At the time, the client had felt that their website’s flow was clunky and the information was not clear.</li>

                    <p class = "about-body-writing">After research, our team begun wireframe creation by dividing into two groups. One focused on the Squarespace-based main website. Team members A, C, and I focused  the Square-powered ordering page. My role involved understanding Square's platform and helping out with mid-fidelity mockup development. Initially, we crafted low-fidelity mockups for both platforms' navigation bars, approved by the client.</p>
                    
                    
                    <p class = "about-body-writing">We also focused on mid-fidelity mockups.  My task was to verify  the design feasibility within Square's limitations. After creating mid-fidelity mockups for both websites, the team, excluding myself, finalized wireframes. I ensured alignment with Square's capabilities. Finally, members A and C integrated all wireframes into a prototype.</p>

                    <p class = "about-body-writing">This project taught me valuable lessons in UX research, design,  adaptability, teamwork, and leadership. Despite challenges like COVID-19 regulations, I learned to embrace change and gleaned skills from my colleagues: UX design and research from B and C, effective leadership from A, and adaptability from D, who supported the team at every step. Additionally, our client's open-mindedness expanded my perspective. Moving forward, our client plans to create a mobile prototype. Find the desktop prototype link below.
