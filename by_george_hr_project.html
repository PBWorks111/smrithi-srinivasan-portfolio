Second, the app had to have a communication feature for human resources advisors. My supervisor wanted to provide free advice by having a few human resource advisors on standby.

                 <p class = "bg_paragraph">This was the first time I went through the UX design process and I learned many things. First, I learned to iterate and reiterate my designs for this project. I was never done with designing the high-fidelity mockups. There was always something that needed to be tweaked to help make the design better. Secondly, complexity and ambiguity can cause confusion. My main goal was to make sure that user’s understood the purpose of different pages on the app. I needed to make sure that everything had a clear intent. </p>

                <p class = "bg_paragraph">Finally, I learned that design and experience can mix with one another. I was so focused on the function of the app that I did not recognize the need for design until after my usability tests. User interface design and user experience design can intersect one another depending on the situation. It is important to recognize and remember that it is based on the user’s preferences when deciding whether to focus on the experience over the design and vice versa.</p>

                <p class = "bg_paragraph">The next step for this project is to conduct another round of user testing. Since this app only had one round of testing, there could be aspects within the design that might have been missed. There is also the fact that certain laws if there had been any changes to them in the last 1 to 2 years.</p>
