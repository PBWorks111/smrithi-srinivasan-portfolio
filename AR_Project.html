After thinking about how people were turning to websites like Google Arts & Culture , virtual tours, etc to temporarily substitute tours and museum visits, and recognizing that physical landmarks would not last forever, I decided to create an app that showed different ancient buildings in augmented reality. With that, I created a problem statement to help me narrow my focus towards specific interactions.</div>

To help preserve their memories, an education app would be created that contains details about the different physical landmarks with actual 3D renderings of the landmarks themselves. This app would allow users to select different landmarks from different locations around the world. Once a user selects the landmark, they can tap on different parts of the landmark to get facts about it. Users can also increase or decrease the size of landmark to use as models. This is meant to be an educational tool to teach any user about a particular landmark. The app is not limited to any age group and is not meant to replace any apps designed for physical tours.</div>

The app allows users to change the size of these artifacts, listen to sound bites about the artifact’s history, and even read about the artifact’s history on another screen. The main con with this app is that users have to use the app on a flat surface. The artifacts are even categorized by different eras throughout human history. The main difference between what I will design and this app is that I want to focus on physical landmarks rather than actual objects. I also want my app to cover facts regarding the historical and architectural context for each physical landmark rather than just stick to historical facts. </div>

         <div class = "satoshi_paragraph">Normally, in a UX project, I would conduct a user needs assessment to understand who my users were, what they were currently looking for in a potential idea, and how they would utilize the app. In this case, my project was focused on learning how to design with an AR tool as a whole. Prior to beginning the design process, I tried to figure out who my user was. Since my app was an educational app that was meant to substitute travelling, I decided to focus on two user groups: older people who like to travel and children who were currently learning about history.</div>

            <li class = "satoshi_testing_the_chatbot_li">The app should be used vertically on mobile devices instead of horizontally. One user (my mom) mentioned that it felt more natural to hold the phone in one hand and do interactions in another. </li>
            <li class = "satoshi_testing_the_chatbot_li">The settings panel was taken down since users can manually touch and change the orientation of the historical landmark. The user felt it would be more natural to move the app on our own. </li>

I would also have found users to test my design on instead relying on my student instructor and mom for feedback. </p>

            <p class = "satoshi_paragraph">This project was a great introduction in augmented reality. I think that if I had more time, I would have attempted to polish my final design and recording.  This was an opportunity for me to learn how to think outside of my normal scope of thinking and try a new tool. It also allowed me to be creative and think like a game designer in a way as I had to learn how to figure out camera angles, how people hold their phones, etc while utilizing this app. Although this mini-project was really short, I’m glad that I was able to try something new.  </p>
