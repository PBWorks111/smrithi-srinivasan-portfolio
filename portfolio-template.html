I only considered sexual harassment prevention apps in my competitor research, excluding employment apps. Additionally, any changes in sexual harassment prevention laws over the past one to two years were not reflected in the app.</p>

                    <h2 class="about-section-title">Conclusion</h2>
                    <p class = "about-body-writing">This was my first UX design project, and I learned a lot. I discovered the importance of continuous iteration, as high-fidelity mockups always needed tweaks. Complexity and ambiguity can confuse users, so clarity and clear intent are crucial. </p>
                    <p class = "about-body-writing">I also realized that design and experience are interconnected. Initially focused on functionality, I saw the need for design improvements only after usability testing. Balancing user experience and design depends on user preferences. </p>
                    <p class = "about-body-writing">The next step is another round of user testing to catch any missed aspects and update for any recent changes in laws.</p>
