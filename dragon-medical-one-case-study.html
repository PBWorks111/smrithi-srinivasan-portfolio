                    <p class = "about-body-writing">Dragon Medical One is a voice transcribing tool doctors can use to record patient notes. It’s also a leading voice dictation tool for users who don’t have the ability to write, type, etc. For Dragon Medical One, the user interfaces needed to be catalogued for future designers and engineers in the company. The product also needed a user analysis/heuristic evaluation to identify any usability painpoints.  </p>

                    <p class = "about-body-writing">While documenting Dragon Medical One's UIs, I initiated a user analysis to identify potential areas for system enhancement. Adopting the perspective of a new user unfamiliar with medical transcription tools, I meticulously traversed through the entire system. I maintained a personal log to record every identified pain point, mirroring the breakdown utilized for the UI catalog. By using  Norman Nielsen's heuristics, I categorized each problem area and then applied a rating system to assess the criticality of each pain point.</p>

                        <li class ="li-items">Critical Issue</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class = "about-body-writing">For the final deliverable, I made a web page using a tool called Microsoft Sway. The webpage was broken into every section as listed above. Each section included the following:</p>
