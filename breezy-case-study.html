                    <p class = "about-body-writing">Following the clickstream analysis, I conducted a survey with previous users over three weeks. Despite only six previous users responding, we combined their feedback with responses from five new users in our unmoderated usability test to get more results.</p>

Previous users rated Breezy's personality as 7/10, while new users rated it as 8.4/10. Most users described her as cute and fun, though two saw her more as a to-do list. </p>

                        <p class = "about-image-caption">We also asked previous users how they would describe Breezy in a few short words. Among new users, 3 out of 5 found her to be a lot of fun. We also asked how easy it was to use Breezy’s features non a scale of 1 to 10. Both previous and new users found her features easy to use, with scores averaging 9.33/10 and 9.6/10, respectively.  </p>

                        <p class = "about-image-caption">Finally, we asked users what Breezy’s most memorable features were. New users appreciated the ability to prioritize tasks, while previous users liked the daily reminders.  </p>

It should be noted that these users between their early 20s and early 40s.</p>

                    <p class = "about-body-writing">After my research, I drafted recommendations for immediate implementation to my supervisor. Firstly, my supervisor and I decided to give the welcome message clearer instructions for users to understand Breezy's functions easily. Secondly, we expanded the chatbot's personality by incorporating personalized responses on topics based on user feedback.</p>

                    </div> 
                    <p class = "about-body-writing">Initially, I suggested changing the reminders system either by removing it entirely or offering further customization options. However, due to limitations with Manychat, it wasn’t feasible. Lastly, I created user personas to better understand our target audience, as their identity was initially unknown during the research phase.</p>

                    <h2 class="about-section-title">Limitations</h2>
                    <p class = "about-body-writing">I encountered several limitations during this project. Firstly, the low response rate to my survey - only 6 from old users and 5 from new users – made it statistically insignificant even though there was a three-week wait for more responses. Another consideration is that I was given advice to reach out to users who used potential competitors of Breezy to understand their thoughts about her. However, at the time, my supervisor and I only knew of one competitor.There was also the possibility of bias in responses from previous users who may have been friends or family of employees. Finally, , our user selection wasn't restricted to one-time Breezy users. We tried to be inclusive as possible to get more users. </p>

                <section id="Breezy-Conclusion">
                    <h2 class="about-section-title">Conclusion</h2>
                    <p class = "about-body-writing">This project brought me full circle, returning to the company that introduced me to UX/UI. I learned Breezy's unique personality and expanded its potential. It rekindled my interest in chatbots and user interaction with AI. As my first solo UX research project, it was a valuable learning experience. Moving forward, I aim to stay in AI and explore beyond chatbots..</p>
